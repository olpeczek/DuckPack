# DuckPack

This is my custom-edited texture pack for Minecraft!
Attention! txt works only on 1.8.x ( np.1.8.9, 1.8.5)
## Changes

- **3D Bed**: I redesigned the bed to make it 3D, giving it a more realistic appearance (this one was challenging to create, but I made it work!).
- **Slime Blocks**: Slime blocks have been modified to fit the theme of this pack.
- **Villagers**: Villagers are now retextured to look like "Squidward" from SpongeBob, adding a touch of fun to the game!

Enjoy the new look and feel of Minecraft with these changes!
